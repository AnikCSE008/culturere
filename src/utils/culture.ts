This means: In cultures that are comfortable with uncertainty, stakeholders may be inclined toward experimentation and iterative approaches. In contrast, in cultures that are risk-averse, stakeholders may demand detailed plans and clear risk mitigations. Depending on the cultural context, practitioners should either advocate flexible methods or provide more structure and assurance." },
